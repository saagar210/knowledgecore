# Sync Head Signature Chain v3

## Purpose
Define sync head schema v3 with managed-identity-backed device certificate authorship and deterministic signature-chain validation inputs.

## Invariants
- Sync head write semantics remain deterministic and canonical-json serialized.
- Sync head v2 and v3 are both readable during migration window.
- New writes must emit schema v3 only.
- Merge and pull flows must reject heads that fail identity/certificate verification.

## Non-goals
- Introducing automatic trust acceptance policies.
- Altering snapshot payload determinism from v2.
- Replacing existing conflict artifact semantics.

## Interface contracts
- Sync head v3 fields:
  - `schema_version = 3`
  - `snapshot_id`
  - `manifest_hash`
  - `created_at_ms`
  - `trust` (model, fingerprint, updated_at_ms)
  - `author_device_id`
  - `author_fingerprint`
  - `author_signature`
  - `author_cert_id`
  - `author_chain_hash`
- Validation rules:
  - all required authorship fields present for v3
  - chain hash must match enrolled certificate chain
  - signature must verify against canonical signing payload

## Determinism and version-boundary rules
- v3 payload canonicalization order is fixed.
- Signature input bytes are canonical-json and stable.
- Any signing input shape changes require schema version bump.
- v2 compatibility remains read-only for migration period.

## Failure modes and AppError mapping
- `KC_SYNC_AUTH_FAILED`
- `KC_TRUST_SIGNATURE_INVALID`
- `KC_TRUST_CERT_CHAIN_INVALID`
- `KC_SYNC_KEY_MISMATCH`

## Acceptance tests
- v3 head write/read round-trip retains byte-stable canonical serialization.
- v2 heads remain readable and mapped correctly.
- Invalid/missing v3 authorship fields fail deterministically.
- Signature mismatch fails with `KC_TRUST_SIGNATURE_INVALID`.

## Rollout gate and stop conditions
### Rollout gate
- `cargo test -p kc_core -- sync`
- `cargo test -p kc_core -- schema_`
- canonical Rust gate from `knowledgecore-docpack/AGENTS.md`

### Stop conditions
- New writes emit non-v3 schema after migration activation.
- Merge/pull accepts invalid chain or signature.
- Missing schema updates for sync head v3 contracts.
