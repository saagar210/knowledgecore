# GA Closeout Control Log

## Purpose
Establish immutable closeout controls for KnowledgeCore GA launch readiness and execution.

## Control Snapshot
- Captured at (UTC): `2026-02-15T07:04:54Z`
- Base branch: `master`
- Active milestone branch: `codex/closeout-c0-launch-control-lock`
- Repository cleanliness at lock: `master` clean; only local branch at lock-time was `master`

## Locked Decisions
- Launch model: `Production GA`
- Audience: `Leadership + Engineering`
- Change policy: `Code freeze`
- Platform target: `macOS-first`
- Artifact trust requirement: `Signed + notarized`
- Release target: `v0.1.0` unless a critical closeout hotfix requires patch increment

## Safety Artifacts
- Safety tag: `safety/pre-closeout-20260215T070454Z`
- Git bundle backup: `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/.git-backups/pre-closeout-20260215T070454Z.bundle`
- Branch inventory log: `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/.git-backups/pre-closeout-20260215T070454Z.log`

## Required Signoffs
- Engineering owner: validates full technical gates and determinism contracts
- QA owner: validates functional and regression acceptance for release candidate
- Release owner: validates artifact integrity, publishing checklist, and go/no-go package

## Stop/Go Governance
### Stop Conditions
- Any required gate fails (`cargo`, schema/RPC, desktop, or bench)
- Signing identity unavailable, notarization fails, or notarization verification fails
- Published/publish-ready artifacts fail checksum verification
- Missing required signoff in go/no-go checklist
- Any P0/P1 unresolved at go/no-go

### Go Conditions
- All required gates pass and are documented with timestamps
- Bench checksum stable across required repeated runs
- Signed/notarized/stapled artifacts generated and checksum manifest verified
- Go/no-go checklist completed with all signoffs
- Release publication record completed with immutable references

## Critical-Fix Exception Path (During Freeze)
- Branch naming: `codex/closeout-hotfix-<id>`
- Scope: minimal required fix only
- Mandatory reruns: full Rust gate + schema/RPC gates + desktop gate when applicable
- If schema-affecting: update `SCHEMA_REGISTRY.md` and matching schema tests
- Record all deltas in closeout evidence docs prior to merge

## Verification Command Sources
- `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/AGENTS.md`
- `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/04-post-dk-ops-and-followup-policy.md`
- `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/CHECKLIST_VERIFICATION.md`

## Control Amendment (Pilot Pivot)
- Amendment captured at (UTC): `2026-02-15T07:18:34Z`
- Trigger: Apple Developer ID signing and notarization credentials unavailable on release host.
- GA status: `Deferred (NO-GO)`
- Approved interim release class: `Internal Pilot`
- Policy update:
  - External/public GA distribution remains blocked.
  - Internal pilot release is permitted with explicit risk disclosure and controlled audience.
  - GA path remains gated on signed + notarized + stapled artifact evidence.
- Amendment evidence references:
