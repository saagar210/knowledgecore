# KnowledgeCore macOS Pilot Release Notes v0.1.0-pilot.1

## Release Classification
- Classification: `Pilot (GA deferred)`
- Decision date (UTC): `2026-02-15`
- Prior target superseded: `Production GA v0.1.0`
- Superseding constraint: Apple Developer ID signing/notarization credentials unavailable on release host.

## Audience
- Internal engineering
- Leadership stakeholders (status visibility)
- Designated pilot users operating on trusted devices

## What Is Shipping in Pilot
- Full AF-AJ capability surface already merged on `master` and validated in closeout gates.
- macOS artifacts generated by canonical build gate:
  - `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/target/release/bundle/macos/KnowledgeCore Desktop.app`
  - `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/target/release/bundle/dmg/KnowledgeCore Desktop_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg`
- Gate evidence and checksum inventory are recorded in:
  - `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/09-ga-validation-evidence.md`
  - `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/10-ga-artifact-manifest-v0.1.0.md`

## What Is Explicitly Not Shipping (GA-only)
- Public GA distribution claim.
- Apple Developer ID signed artifacts.
- Apple notarization + stapled ticket validation.
- Gatekeeper-first-install trust path suitable for external self-serve users.

## Installation and Verification (Pilot)
1. Verify artifact checksums before use:
- `shasum -a 256 /Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/target/release/bundle/dmg/KnowledgeCore\ Desktop_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg`

2. Confirm known trust state (expected in pilot):
- `codesign -dv --verbose=4 /Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/target/release/bundle/macos/KnowledgeCore\ Desktop.app`
- Expected: `Signature=adhoc`, `TeamIdentifier=not set`

3. Install only on explicitly approved pilot machines under internal policy.

## Deferred to GA Completion
- Developer ID certificate import/availability on release host.
- Notarytool profile setup and notarization pipeline execution.
- Stapling and post-staple verification.
- Re-issuance of release as GA (`v0.1.0` or `v0.1.1` if hotfix required).

## Risk Disclosure (Pilot)
- Gatekeeper friction and manual trust steps are expected.
- Artifact trust posture is below GA bar until signing/notarization is complete.
- Pilot users must be informed that release class is non-GA.

## Traceability
- Control baseline: `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/08-ga-closeout-control-log.md`
- Validation evidence: `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/09-ga-validation-evidence.md`
- Artifact evidence: `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/10-ga-artifact-manifest-v0.1.0.md`
- Decision record: `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/14-ga-decision-record.md`
