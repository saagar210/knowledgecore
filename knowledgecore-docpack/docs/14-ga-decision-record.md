# Closeout Decision Record (C4)

## Decision Metadata
- Decision timestamp (UTC): `2026-02-15T07:20:51Z`
- Milestone: `C4 — Final Go/No-Go Review Gate`
- Branch: `codex/closeout-c4-go-no-go-record`
- Candidate target: `v0.1.0`

## Command Source of Truth
- `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/AGENTS.md`
- `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/04-post-dk-ops-and-followup-policy.md`
- `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/CHECKLIST_VERIFICATION.md`

## Decision Outcome
- GA track: `NO-GO`
- Pilot track: `GO (internal only)`

## Rationale
1. Functional, schema/RPC, and performance validation gates are green.
2. Artifact signing/notarization requirements for GA remain unmet.
3. Leadership and engineering requested continuity via a controlled pilot rather than blocking all launch activity.

## Gate Evidence
- Full validation baseline and bench-x2 evidence:
  - `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/09-ga-validation-evidence.md`
- Artifact inventory and trust-gap evidence:
  - `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/10-ga-artifact-manifest-v0.1.0.md`
- Final C4 rerun evidence:
  - `/Users/d/Projects/knowledgecore/knowledgecore-docpack/docs/12-ga-go-no-go-checklist.md`

## Blocking Conditions for GA (Open)
- No Developer ID signing identity on release host.
- Missing notarytool keychain profile (`knowledgecore-ga`).
- Notarization and stapling cannot be verified.

## Authorized Pilot Scope
- Internal audience only.
- Explicit risk disclosure that release class is non-GA.
- Controlled distribution and hypercare obligations apply.
- Any Sev1 incident reverts pilot to stop-ship until closure evidence is recorded.

## Required Conditions to Reopen GA
1. Install/import valid Developer ID Application certificate.
2. Configure notary profile credentials.
3. Re-sign, notarize, staple, and verify artifacts.
4. Refresh artifact manifest and rerun final go/no-go gate.

## Signoff Record
- Engineering owner: `Approved pilot GO; GA NO-GO`
- QA owner: `Approved pilot GO; GA NO-GO`
- Release owner: `Approved pilot GO; GA NO-GO`
