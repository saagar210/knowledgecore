# Next Stretch Readiness Note

## Purpose
Confirm post-D窶適 closure readiness and provide a single handoff index for next-phase planning.

## Readiness Status
- D窶適 delivery is closed on `master`.
- Local branch hygiene is completed to single-branch state (`master` only).
- Follow-up governance and deferred-item carry-forward are documented.
- Remaining deferred work is explicitly staged for Phase L/M/N planning.

## Required Reference Set
- D窶適 closure report:
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/docs/03-phase-d-k-closure-report.md`
- Post-D窶適 operations and follow-up policy:
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/docs/04-post-dk-ops-and-followup-policy.md`
- Next-stretch implementation plan:
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/docs/05-next-stretch-plan.md`
- Phase L execution notes:
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/docs/07-phase-l-execution-notes.md`
- Phase L design-lock specs:
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/spec/22-encryption-at-rest-v1-design-lock.md`
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/spec/23-deterministic-zip-packaging-v1-design-lock.md`
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/spec/24-cross-device-sync-v1-design-lock.md`
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/spec/25-advanced-lineage-ui-v1-design-lock.md`
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/spec/26-deferred-capability-schema-drafts.md`

## Deferred Item Tracking Baseline
- Encryption at rest: planned candidate phase `M`, status `Deferred`.
- Deterministic ZIP packaging: planned candidate phase `N1`, status `Deferred`.
- Cross-device sync: planned candidate phase `N2`, status `Deferred`.
- Advanced lineage UI: planned candidate phase `N3`, status `Deferred`.

## Kickoff Guidance for Next Stretch
1. Run Phase L as a design lock sprint with explicit stop/go criteria per deferred item.
2. Promote only one deferred capability at a time from design-lock to implementation.
3. Require schema registry updates and schema tests for every contract change.
4. Keep canonical Rust/UI/bench gates mandatory for each milestone.

## Phase L Completion Evidence
- Branch: `codex/l-phase-l-design-lock`
- Scope delivered:
  - design-lock spec pack `spec/22` through `spec/26`,
  - draft schema registry section and validation tests,
  - deep preview scaffolding behind `phase_l_preview` compile flags in core/CLI/Tauri/UI.
- Gates executed:
  - `cargo test -p kc_core -p kc_extract -p kc_index -p kc_ask -p kc_cli`
  - `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm tauri build`
  - `cargo test -p kc_core -- schema_`
  - `cargo test -p kc_cli -- schema_`
  - `cargo test -p apps_desktop_tauri -- rpc_`
  - `cargo test -p apps_desktop_tauri -- rpc_schema`
  - `cargo test -p kc_cli --features phase_l_preview --test preview_scaffold`
  - `cargo test -p apps_desktop_tauri --features phase_l_preview --test rpc --test rpc_schema`
- Result: all commands completed successfully.
