# Next Stretch Readiness Note

## Purpose
Confirm post-D窶適 closure readiness and provide a single handoff index for next-phase planning.

## Readiness Status
- D窶適 delivery is closed on `master`.
- Local branch hygiene is completed to single-branch state (`master` only).
- Follow-up governance and deferred-item carry-forward are documented.
- Remaining deferred work is explicitly staged for Phase L/M/N planning.

## Required Reference Set
- D窶適 closure report:
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/docs/03-phase-d-k-closure-report.md`
- Post-D窶適 operations and follow-up policy:
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/docs/04-post-dk-ops-and-followup-policy.md`
- Next-stretch implementation plan:
  - `knowledgecore-docpack/docs/05-next-stretch-plan.md`

## Deferred Item Tracking Baseline
- Encryption at rest: planned candidate phase `M`, status `Deferred`.
- Deterministic ZIP packaging: planned candidate phase `N1`, status `Deferred`.
- Cross-device sync: planned candidate phase `N2`, status `Deferred`.
- Advanced lineage UI: planned candidate phase `N3`, status `Deferred`.

## Kickoff Guidance for Next Stretch
1. Run Phase L as a design lock sprint with explicit stop/go criteria per deferred item.
2. Promote only one deferred capability at a time from design-lock to implementation.
3. Require schema registry updates and schema tests for every contract change.
4. Keep canonical Rust/UI/bench gates mandatory for each milestone.
